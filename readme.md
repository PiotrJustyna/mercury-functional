# mercury-functional

Functional type of code with explicitly separated pure and effectful responsibilities. In contrast to:

* [mercury-legacy](https://github.com/PiotrJustyna/mercury-legacy)
* [mercury-pure-functional](https://github.com/PiotrJustyna/mercury-pure-functional)

it is written exclusively in F# (both aspects of the code: pure and effectful). It demonstrates some useful techniques of dealing with asynchronous code.
